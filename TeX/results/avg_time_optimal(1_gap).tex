    \caption{Average time (seconds) until solved to optimality with a 1\% gap over 5 instances. The gap used to terminate optimisation was the MIPGap for all models except for iterative LBBDs which were terminated by gap between master problem and sub problem. The number of instances not solved to optimality are superscripted. Non-solved instances are not included in average. **** represents that no instances solved in time.}
