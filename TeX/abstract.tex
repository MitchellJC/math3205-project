We re-implemented existing models\cite{roshanaei2017propagating} for solving the distributed operating room scheduling (DORS) problem. We extended the existing formulation with a new LBBD cut and a network formulation, we extended implementation by employing lazy constraints in Gurobi. Results in line with the original paper were not able to be replicated. It was found that all models were unable to scale to larger than 20 patients when solving to optimality. It was found that all models were able to scale up to 80 patients when solving to a 1\% gap. The pure MIP exhibited the best performance in terms of both its ability to solve within time limits and speed when solving to both optimality and a 1\% gap.
